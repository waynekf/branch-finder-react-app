        ! There is a continuing need to show the power of{" "}
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen Garden aims to
        excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the
        existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style
        sheet into this very page. The{" "}
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains the same,
        the only thing that has changed is the external{" "}
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.
      </p>
      <p>
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and
        total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this
        can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating
        what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those
        able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have
        contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.
